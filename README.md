# ESG Evaluation App (CS50 Final Project)

This is a Flask-based web app that evaluates a user's ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) profile based on their responses to a survey. It's my final project for Harvard's [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x), where I wanted to build something that combined backend logic with real-time feedback and simple data visualization.




## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set environment variable: `export FLASK_APP=app.py` (Linux/mac) or `set FLASK_APP=app.py` (Windows)
5. Run the app: `flask run`

## Features

- **User login system**  
  Users can sign up and log in to access their ESG evaluation.

- **Survey-based scoring**  
  The app asks a series of questions across environmental, social, and governance topics, and calculates a score based on the answers.

- **Chart-based results**  
  Scores are visualized in a compact donut chart so users can quickly see how they did in each category.


---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Chart.js via CDN)
- **Backend**: Flask (Python), Jinja2  
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy  
- **Other**: Flask session management, password hashing with Werkzeug

## Project Status

The main flow â€” survey, scoring, and result visualization â€” is complete.  
Future improvements may include score history or better survey analytics.
