# ESG Evaluation App (CS50 Final Project)

This is a Flask-based web app that evaluates a user's ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) profile based on their responses to a survey. It's my final project for Harvard's [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x), where I wanted to build something that combined backend logic with real-time feedback and simple data visualization.

---

## Features

- **User login system**  
  Users can sign up and log in to access their ESG evaluation.

- **Survey-based scoring**  
  The app asks a series of questions across environmental, social, and governance topics, and calculates a score based on the answers.

- **Chart-based results**  
  Scores are visualized in a compact donut chart so users can quickly see how they did in each category.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js  
- **Backend**: Flask (Python), Jinja2  
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy  
- **Other**: Flask session management, password hashing with Werkzeug

## Project Status

The main flow â€” survey, scoring, and result visualization â€” is complete.  
- I'm currently adding score history so logged-in users can see previous evaluations.
+ The core survey and result flow is complete. Future improvements may include result history or better survey analytics.
